## Structured diagnostics for Rust applications.

`emit` is a structured logging framework for manually instrumenting Rust applications with an expressive syntax inspired by [Message Templates](https://messagetemplates.org).

`emit` represents all diagnostics as _events_; a combination of timestamp or timespan, template, and properties. Traditional log records, spans in a distributed trace, and metric samples are all represented as events. Having a unified model of all these signals means you can always capture your diagnostics in one way or another.

```toml
[dependencies.emit]
version = "0.11.0-alpha.2"

[dependencies.emit_term]
version = "0.11.0-alpha.2"
```

```rust
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let rt = emit::setup()
        .emit_to(emit_term::stdout())
        .init();

    greet("Rust");

    rt.blocking_flush(Duration::from_secs(5));
}

#[emit::span("Greet {user}")]
fn greet(user: &str) {
    emit::info!("Hello, {user}!");
}
```

## Current status

This is alpha-level software. It implements a complete framework but has almost no tests and needs a lot more documentation.

## Getting started

See the `examples` directory and `emit` documentation for how to get started with `emit`.
