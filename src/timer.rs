/*!
The [`Timer`] type.

Timers are a simple mechanism to track the start and end times of some operation. They're based on readings from a [`Clock`], which isn't monotonic. That means timers can give an approximate timespan based on its readings, but are susceptible to clock drift.

Timers are used by [`crate::Span`]s to produce the [`Extent`] on their events.
